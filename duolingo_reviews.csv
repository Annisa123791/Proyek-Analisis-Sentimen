Z Z;"Well, I'm finally deleting my account after a 462 day streak. I know absolutely none of the language this supposedly ""taught"". Never gives any kind of tips, associations, or etymology to help learn vocabulary, never explains grammar, never gives literal translations, never gives any real repetition or actual practice, the list just goes on and on. They really make learning a new language a horrible experience.";1

Victoria Noble;Would be nice to see language XP again. I typically never leave reviews, however I've been using Duolingo for years. First started when I was in the 10th grade and I'm now 22 years old. I like to learn different languages, and one of the upsides was seeing your progress in each. I'd like to be able to see how much XP I have in EACH language rather that it just be one big number. Very disappointing. Whoever thought to take it away needs to lose their job ASAP. Insha Allah 🙏🏾, I would've given 5;4

Vince Yamud;Audio for listening activities are delayed. I cannot avail any Super Duolingo subscriptions for no apparent reason, and the app has become laggier and laggier over the weeks.

Anthony LC;Why is my the duo lingo app icon weird looking. It's ugly to look at. But this isn't the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. I've been trying to learn Romanian for the past 2 months using this app, and I find it tough to continue.. The content is just plain, and the sentences I learn don't apply to real situations. It's not worth the money. I also don't appreciate that duolingo taunts me via notifications. If I don't have time to do it don't make me feel bad.... Anyway, that's my 2 cents.;2

Aditya Raj;Great and easy to use;5
Sga Sga;This is a great app. It really helped me learn better Spanish. I would highly recommend this app if you want to learn a new language or more than one language. But the reason that I gave this a four star rating is because I saw you could learn piano and music on this app, so I tried to get it, but I couldn't find out how to! I tried everything that youtube told me to do, but it still won't work. Other than the issue I mentioned, it's a very good app. Also, duolingo, are you sick? You look awful;4
AISWARYA M A;very good app i like it;4

Sathya Sivanandhan;Why tamil language is not having;1
Ömər Rzazadə;Would put zero if could - It's not free, and is full of ads. I may understand that you need to earn money, but you may reduce the amount of ads (to make it not to show at every lesson's end), f.e. by putting it into menu or something (and making it not to affect phone's performance) First days with Super Duolingo were good (I watched an ad for it), but when it ended, the life also did. The app is more made to earn money, and annoy everyone with Super Duolingo ad rather than teaching;1

Yassine El;Useful;5
Chris Kahl;You can learn at your own pace. Spend as much or as little time as you want. I don't mind taking a lesson over if I fail it. I don't see the need to buy lives, I learn more from trying again. I upgraded to super and it was a lot better. Definitely worth it. My biggest issue is that I have learned enough words yet to carry on or understand a normal conversation. Yet I have learned how to say some things in multiple ways. Please expand the vocabulary before you teach things like tenses.;5

Elizabeth Michael;8-31-24 It WAS a good app, UNTIL...this latest update. I do practice for hearts. But now I'm getting things in the practice I didn't get in the lessons. I'm done. 330 days and I quit. 0 stars. 9-8-23 The hearts gotta go. For a dyslexic learner like me, the hearts are a distraction that hinder true learning. I practice repeatedly until I get something, no matter the mistakes I make in the doing. The hearts prevent that. Why are the hearts a punishment for mobile when they aren't present for pc?;1

Min McGlaughn;Great app for learning a language. I am particularly frustrated with the super subscription. When signing up for the trial, you only have the option for the yearly price of 92 dollars. The trial says it will notify 2 days before the end, but it didn't. I'm so mad I want to delete the app. But I just paid 92 dollars so that would be dumb. Don't use the super trial unless you're ready to drop food for a week on it.;1

Péter Sánta;Pls do not change the app icon to an ugly/drunk/sick duo in the future. It is agressively stressful, I was thinking on cancel my subscription.;1
Pug Kitty (Protect the squirrels!);i like it! but it's not the BEST learning app in the world. personally, i think duocards is better, duocards is just where you pick a language and then press the ➕️ button down below on the right corner and you type in any english word you want then, then you press save, back out, then press the learn button! and there you go! you learn the new word in like 2 sec or 1 day.;5

Amara Ramgethy;helps me alot;5
Kuba ************;the bird scares me.;5
John Pattison;Not convinced it's teaching me conversational Japanese. Also the voices for some lessons speak some words so softly, or slur them, such that it can be very easy to get an exercise wrong because you literally do not hear a word, or cannot hear it correctly.;3
Itai Y.;The owl is sick! Please cure the owl immediately! I do not want a sick owl on my home screen!;1
Kameron Foster;"Make it so we can easily opt out of icon changes especially if we have paid for the subscription. I cannot find a way to change the icon back to normal in android app. ""Sick duo"" may be enough for me to uninstall even tho I have paid for it.";1

Cody Smith;It's a alright. They do teach the lessons efficiently, but it kinda gets repetitive. Advanced to the next lesson sets is difficult and requires time, so patience is key;4

Ian Laurence Abellanosa;I Should have never downloaded this app he kidnapped my family (satire it really good);5
Velvadere;the life system makes the learning slow, but it is extremely helpful to be able to repeat steps.;4
Ronnie and;While I continue to learn and enjoy Duo, your insistence in using American spellings (movie theatre, rest room, appartment building, store (instead of shop)) etc., most irritating and unnecessary.;3
Dominik Majkowski;Has potential, but there's too much adds, reminds me of all the terrible mobile games, forcing an add every time you do anything;1
KL Collins;I like playing Duolingo. I lost my phone so I have to start over! But I still like learning another language, French.;5
Jelan mohammed;"Positive: There are many languages and learning on it is good. , there are no malfunctions, and you can also learn the letters of each language. Negatives: All the ads I have are about Super Duolingo The way the picture looks made my brother cry When I started learning Japanese the first word was ""sushi"" I'm used to it being the first word or the first unit about introducing myself I literally still can't form a standard sentence U want to install it ok but I don't really support it";2

Sophia Alyanna Villegas;Fun;4
Leticia Millard;I have had to install this app like 5 times since I started using it only 3 days ago because it keeps freezing. Frustrating Still. I have had to install multiple times and still will not let me practice anything but Intermediate English. Not a great experience.;1
Rejoice Damanka;nice app;5
Moira Keenan;I enjoyed this once upon a time. Many languages had missing components. I paid monthly for membership. Inconsistencies occurred throughout. The English grammar was bad, and very little guidance about German grammar was present. Using only US English confused many things, such as translations, eg, Toilette - toilet/bathroom, Badezimmer - bathroom/ bathroom (meaning toilet). It was also biased! That made me remove it. More recent reviews, indicate it's gone from bad to worse. No more for me!;1
Claire Mac;I feel the need to say somewhere that I really don't appreciate how the icon changes to a sick duo when I am too sick too practice. I am dying over here I don't need to feel shamed about not being able to keep up with my goals. Very discouraging and not cute.;3
Mark Owens;It helpede learn Japanese ocha;5

Joy O'Brien;perfect for all ages;5
Nazanin Eslah;"that's the greatest and the best app for learning, but i am so sad why we just can't learn with our language and must try with English to other languages . Half of my mastake because of that i don't mastery in English. please put "" persian "" in basic language to make it easier for us🙏";5
John F;This is a great app when it comes to the languages themselves, but it is beyond frustrating when it comes to usability. There is an endless wave of pop-ups for social options, streaks, add-ons, trials, events, etc. I really wish you could turn off all of these random things and use the app as an academic resource. Their new icon is also really weird.;2
Maggie Coles;I really enjoy using Duolingo but not the constant requests to upgrade!;4

Sharon Hurn;the new icon is disgusting. Considering uninstalling;1
Sarah Kilduff;Y'all, making the owl icon progressively more and more disgusting is turning me off from using it. I just removed it from my home screen, and with ADHD that's basically the same as forgetting it exists. Not a good look, friend.;3

Samuel Allen;Was decent till I found out they use ai, should probably stop using your funds for stupid adverts and start using them to pay your employees;1
Colin Hughes;I've been doing Duolingo for 6+ years now and haven't missed a single day. However, the app gets worse and worse. Despite submitting five bug reports and getting no reply, I've been doing that same set of lessons over and over for the past couple of months because it randomly resets your progress. Terrible app, but even worse support!;1

Jonea B.;What in sam hill happened to the app icon in the store? Duo needs some antibiotics. Aside from that, I'm glad they're including more varieties to lesson plans, but it feels like some languages get better features/treatments than others.;2
Nickie Biel;brilliant app, however the frustrating thing is that you have to spell correctly, even one letter you get a WRONG! if you're dyslexic you will find it really hard.;4

Sakthi;It's Most Worthable Platform from beginners;5
Sam Nat;I've had an account with duolingo since 2013. Unfortunately, those in charge of the service decided to fire 10% of their work force and replace many of them with AI, which has also ruined the quality of the lessons. Morally, I can no longer use this service, and I have deleted my account. I highly encourage anyone also opposed to the rampant use of AI and replacement of a far superior human workforce do the same.;1

Nathan Cosart;I have always had a difficult time with learning new languages, duolingo has given me the tools and resources to learn at my own pace. Now I'm surprising myself every day with my retention rate. It's easy to go back and practice the lessons I had trouble with and not worry about mistakes as much. Edit: I wish I could see the xp learned for each individual language on mobile again;4
Olivia Djouranov;Duolingo is a useful way to learn new words in your desired language. However, I do have constructive criticism which I hope the developers will take on board: regarding international languages e.g English, Spanish. First of all, English comes with the American flag which is inaccurate. Second, native Spanish and Latin American have different pronunciations. Duolingo uses the Spanish flag with Latin American pronunciation which can be a bit confusing.;4
Habib Sher Tajak;It's very Good App for learning languages;5
Mia Piening;Pls Duo. I need my family back. Pls pookie >///<;5
Leane;It is an Amazing amazing app. I would recomend it. I would also recomend duolingo to add another language. It's not a language that is widely spoken but it would be good to learn for for people in this area as wel. It is called Afrikaans.;4
Mary Norman;I am Navajo and have been reading, writing and speaking it my entire life. This platform mispells a lot of words. for example: shizhé'é is the proper spelling, the spelling on Duolingo is shizhe'é. spelling matters with the accents on words. using the wrong accent in a Navajo word can change the meaning completely when pronouncing it. It also teaches non-native speakers the incorrect pronunciation. if you're using this app solely on its own, I do not recommend it.;2
David Correia;I'm a long time user. duolingo's new icon is gross. if you are considering downloading or worse yet purchasing duolingo I would highly recommend against it.;1
Divine Favour;amazing app,I'm learning so much;5
Ioana Andrei;DUO PLEASE LET MY FAMILY GO, I RATED YOU 5 STARS PLEASE! I ONLY MISSED 1 DAY😭 okay but jokes aside, Duolingo is a great app. It helps you learn any language you want easily and kinda fast;5

samsain me;I like the app, pretty fun while learning but the one thing I hate the most is the ad after every lesson, I can't exit the ad and the only thing I have to do is fully close Duolingo and reopen it, which I lose all xp I gained as it said.;3

Utilka;i didnt expect it to be as useful as it proves to be. not regretting 80 grn subscription. although lesson variety could use improvement. also focus on practice is good but at least some theory would be nice. also, in the dutch course i find a few phrases that repeat too often, to the point that i unwillingly memorise answers instead of learning the language.;4

Sagittarius serpentarius;Duolingo is a life saver. I have GCSE exams coming up and to complete the entire French course I had about 1 year and a half compared to my classmates who had a total of 3 years (we travelled to UK from india). I managed to cover almost everything I had missed. Without duolingo I would have been a lost cause in French GCSE and for sure failed. Yes, it has a lot of ads but nothing good is available without a catch.;5
Harshit Tiwari;duolingo is tha ama nhi na aap 🙂;3
Emma Olson;Love the course but some of my complaints are when I asked my Spanish friend if I spelt something right in my Spanish course he said that this Spanish is actually way different then people who grew up with Spanish actually talk. Also,why is the birds face on the front cover ap discusting? It makes me not want to practice because it seems like you're clicking on an ugly exhausted bird face, and he looks like he's tired from me constantly making mistakes when Im trying to learn the Spanish.;3

Shane McDonald;Update: I am over a year into Duolingo. I feel like I hit a road block. I am overwhelmed with conjugating Spanish verbs. Duolingo has basic lessons on conjugation, but not nearly enough practice for me to memorize the rules. Original: A very fun way to learn a new language. I am impressed by how much I have learned in six months. I spent five years learning French in grade school and I feel I learned more Spanish from Duolingo in less than a year.;4

Teodora Handziev;I have been using this app for a year and I had a 300 day streak. I actually found this app really useful when it was about learning to write in other language and to speak, but it was pretty much useless when it was about learning grammar and new words. Also, one day my streak randomly reseted even tho I did my lesson every day so if you could please fix this and add more efficient ways to learn.;1

Michael Anand-Obleton;If you're serious about learning a language, follow your lesson path, pronounce every word you read out loud as identically to the speaker as you can, and ignore all the scoring competition -- all it does is distract you from the real joy of becoming more fluent and authentic every day. Bottom line: DuoLingo works -- I learned Italian like a boss. Now I'm teaching it. 🏆 Pro tip: Try to speak just like a DuoLingo character whose accent and voice you love (for me it's the Italian dad Eddy). 🇮🇹;5

Also wish that it wasn't as expensive or that you didn't have to commit for an entire year for the better rate. But I guess they need to make profit.. I'm doing Japanese and I feel like there are certain things it could do better like teaching certain staple phrases sooner or explaining certain nuances before you actually encounter them.;4

Avah C;Very good app in my experience but I have a few problems I want to just say! 1. Sometimes when a little ad u can just swipe away before the Super Duolingo one comes up the screen turns black leaving ur reward or anything u were just doing lost. 2. Please don't put people with Super Duolingo on my leaderboard, I get they paid and stuff but it's not fair BC they have more privileges obviously they're gonna be on the top. 3. You should add a options and details with the writing course!;5
